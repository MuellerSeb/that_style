# Super cool test project # {#cool}

This is just a basic description of the project, see other pages for more.
*This is **really** just for testing!*

## Some more info

Honestly, just ignore this text and the whole documentation in general!
\f[
    \int_\infty \text{d}x\, x^2 = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
\f]

# Even more headers # {#even_more}
And somehow some more unneeded text.

\section sec_test A test section
As per usual: ignore it, there is nothing here that would be even remotely interesting.

\subsection sec_sub_test A subsection
Bla bla

\subsubsection sec_sub_sub_test Subsubsection
This is getting ridiculous. But maybe you should look here: \ref INSTALL

\paragraph par Paragraph
I have no idea what to write anymore


You can use it like:
\includelineno example.cpp
